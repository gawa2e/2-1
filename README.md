## Automated Grading Program

While working on an ‚ÄúAutomated Grading Program‚Äù project during my high school Information Science class, I became fascinated by the idea of processing human language with computers. Although I was a beginner and had "no" knowledge of the field of NLP, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of discussing and contemplating how computers could accurately understand and evaluate the meaning of the language we use ü§ó. When I entered university, I learned that this was the field of NLP, and I have since been refining my interest in it.   

It was a pivotal momentüî• that became the starting point for my career path, which is why I‚Äôm archiving it here.

This is the original archive of a document I wrote in my second year of high school.
