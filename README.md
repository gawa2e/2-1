## Automated Grading Program

While working on an “Automated Grading Program” project during my high school Information Science class, I became fascinated by the idea of processing human language with computers. Although I was a beginner and had no knowledge of the field of NLP, I thoroughly enjoyed the process of discussing and contemplating how computers could accurately understand and evaluate the meaning of the language we use. When I entered university, I learned that this was the field of NLP, and I have since been refining my interest in it. It was a pivotal moment that became the starting point for my career path, which is why I’m archiving it here.

These are the original archive of a document I wrote in my second year of high school.
